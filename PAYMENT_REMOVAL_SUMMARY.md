#### **Environment Variables**
- ✅ **Removed Stripe variables**: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- ✅ **Updated example files**: Removed from `.env.example` and deployment guides

## **🎯 Current State:**

### **Booking Flow (Simplified):**
1. User selects seats
2. Booking is created immediately
3. Seats are marked as occupied
4. Booking is marked as `isPaid: true`
5. No payment processing required

### **Environment Variables Required:**
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...
JWT_SECRET=your_secret
TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_key
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### **Optional Variables:**
```
SMTP_USER=your_smtp_user
SMTP_PASS=your_smtp_password

## **✅ Benefits:**

1. **Simplified Deployment**: No payment gateway configuration needed
2. **Faster Setup**: Fewer environment variables to configure
3. **Reduced Complexity**: No payment processing logic
4. **Easier Testing**: Direct booking creation without payment flow
5. **No External Dependencies**: No Stripe API integration

## **🚀 Next Steps:**

1. **Commit and push changes** to GitHub
2. **Redeploy to Vercel** with updated environment variables
3. **Test booking flow** - should work without payment
4. **Update frontend** if any payment-related UI exists

## **🎯 Expected Behavior:**
